# htconfig-vault
This package configures an [OpenBao](https://openbao.org) server
for use with [htgettoken](https://github.com/fermitools/htgettoken).
Users of htgettoken always have to initially authenticate with OIDC,
but after that access can be renewed with either kerberos or ssh.

In addition to making it easy to configure the server, this package includes an
([oauth secrets plugin](https://github.com/openbao/openbao-plugin-secrets-oauthapp))
and a
([ssh authentication plugin](https://github.com/42wim/vault-plugin-auth-ssh)).

OpenBao is a fully open source fork of
[Hashicorp Vault](https://vaultproject.io) so that is the history of
the name of this package.
The server is still often referred to as a Vault server including on this page.
Unlike the Vault project, the OpenBao project has accepted our
modifications so we we can use the builtin jwt/oidc "plugin."

## Mailing list

If you set up a Vault server following these instructions, please
[subscribe to the mailing list](https://listserv.fnal.gov/scripts/wa.exe?SUBED1=HTVAULT-ADMIN&A=1)
to stay updated on developments or to ask questions.

## Installation

The rpm is available in the
[Open Science Grid yum repositories](https://osg-htc.org/docs/common/yum/#install-the-osg-repositories).
After enabling the OSG repositories, do this as root to install vault
and htvault-config:
```
yum install htvault-config
systemctl enable vault
systemctl enable htvault-config
```


## Configuration

If you want to enable debugging, uncomment the indicated line in
`/etc/sysconfig/htvault-config`.

Put X.509 host credentials in `/etc/htvault-config/hostcert.pem`
and `/etc/htvault-config/hostkey.pem`.  The former should be
world-readable and the latter should be owned by the
'vault' user id and mode 400.  For a production system make sure that
those credentials get renewed before expiry and vault gets restarted.

Configuration parameters are done in YAML and can be placed in any
`/etc/htvault-config/config.d/*.yaml` file.  The files are processed
in alphabetical order and options are merged from later files into
earlier ones.  If the same parameters are set again in a later file
it overrides the earlier one.  It is recommended to start the file
names with two digit numbers to easily control the order.

If the hostname (\`uname -n\`) of the server does not match the fully
qualified domain name that will be used to access the vault service,
put the full name in the `cluster:` `myname:` configuration variable.
See details about the variable in the
[High Availability](#high-availability) section below
(even if not setting up a High Availability cluster).

### OIDC/Oauth configuration

OIDC/Oauth configuration is done under an "issuers" top-level keyword.
Each list item under that should have the following keywords:

`issuers` keywords
| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---     | :--     |
| name | Issuer name |
| clientid | OIDC Client ID |
| secret  | OIDC Client secret |
| url  | Issuer URL |
| callbackmode | `direct` or `device` (optional, default `device`) |
| credclaim | OIDC id token claim to use for credential key |
| kerbservice | Kerberos service name (optional) |
| roles | List of roles |

If you want a default issuer for htgettoken give that one the
name `default`. 

It may be more convenient for the sake of system configurators (e.g.
puppet) to put the secrets all into a separate file, but if you do that
remember if an issuer name is changed it has to be changed in both
files. 

If you want also want to support kerberos, the `credclaim` used for all
issuers in a Vault instance sharing that kerberos for credential renewal
must map to the users' kerberos IDs.  For that reason, the source of
information for both the OIDC issuer and for the Kerberos Domain
Controller (KDC) must ultimately be from the same database.  See the
discussion on `policydomain` below in the kerberos section to see
whether or not the domain name should be included in the `credclaim`
value.  If there is more than one Kerberos service defined the
`kerbservice` keyword can be used to select a non-default service by
name; the default is to select one that matches the name of the issuer
or otherwise the first one defined.

On the other hand if you want to support ssh instead of kerberos, the
`credclaim` is still needed but ssh authentication will use whatever
value the OIDC issuer includes in that claim.

Each role under roles should have the following keywords:

`roles` keywords
| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---     | :--     |
| name | Role name |
| scopes | List of scopes to request |

There should be a role called `default` because htgettoken will use that
role if no role is given to it.  The scopes list can be in any format
that is accepted by YAML; the most convenient is probably
comma-separated and surrounded by square brackets.  If there are
characters that are special to YAML such as a colon in a scope value, the
scope should be surrounded by double quotes (although a special case is
that a scope can end with a colon without being quoted).

Below are some example configuration files.

20-cilogon.yaml
```
issuers:
  - name: cilogon
    clientid: xxx
    url: https://cilogon.org
    callbackmode: direct
    credclaim: wlcg.credkey
    roles:
      - name: default
        scopes: [profile,email,org.cilogon.userinfo,storage.read:,storage.create:]
      - name: readonly
        scopes: [profile,email,org.cilogon.userinfo,storage.read:]
```

20-wlcg.yaml
```
issuers:
  - name: default
    clientid: xxx
    url: https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/
    callbackmode: device
    credclaim: email
    roles:
      - name: default
        scopes: [profile,email,offline_access,wlcg,wlcg.groups,"storage.read:/","storage.modify:/","storage.create:/"]
  - name: wlcg
    clientid: xxx
    url: https://wlcg.cloud.cnaf.infn.it/
    callbackmode: direct
    credclaim: email
    roles:
      - name: default
        scopes: [profile,email,offline_access,wlcg,wlcg.groups,"storage.read:/","storage.modify:/","storage.create:/"]

```

80-secrets.yaml
```
issuers:
  - name: cilogon
    secret: xxx
  - name: default
    secret: xxx
  - name: wlcg
    secret: xxx
```

Note that the "device" callback mode is not available by default on the
wlcg token issuer, you have to request it from the administrator.  If using
the "direct" method (which is the standard OIDC code flow), register
callback URIs of the form
```
https://<your.host.name>:8200/v1/auth/oidc-<issuer>/oidc/callback
```
where `<issuer>` is replaced by each issuer name configured and
`<your.host.name>` is replaced by the fully qualified domain name of the
vault service.  The token issuer does not need access to that port but
web browsers of end users do, so the vault service may be behind a
firewall if the clients are also behind that firewall.


### Kerberos configuration

If you want to configure Kerberos support use the `kerberos` top-level
keyword.  The Vault kerberos plugin needs LDAP parameters to be set.
Here are the recognized keywords:

`kerberos` keywords
| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---     | :--     |
| name | kerberos service name |
| ldapurl | URL of LDAP server |
| ldapdn | Base DN to use for LDAP user search |
| ldapattr | LDAP attribute matching user name |
| policydomain | Policy domain (optional, default empty) |

There's unfortunately not a standard way to discover values for the ldap
keywords.  They vary per kerberos installation, but there is often some
document available on the internet that shows the right values.  If not,
contact the local administrators of kerberos and LDAP services.

The Vault kerberos plugin strips away the kerberos domain name when
mapping to vault secret storage paths and leaves only the `userid` from
a `userid@domain`.  For that reason, if you define OIDC issuer
`credclaim`s whose values contain a `@domain` name then set
`policydomain` to `"@domain"` to make the vault kerberos permission
policies add in that domain name.  In that way both kerberos and OIDC
issuers will map to the same Vault storage paths, which is what is
needed.  If the issuer `credclaim`s do not contain `@domain` then setting
policydomain is not necessary (but causes no harm because the kerberos
permission policies also always accept paths without the `@domain`).

Note that if an OIDC token issuer supports more than one Identity
Provider (IdP), the htvault-config kerberos credential feature can only
be used by the users that select the IdP that is from the same
organization as the kerberos domain.  Also, in this case care must be
taken to not use a credclaim that is always without `@domain` because
then it might be possible for the same user id used by different
people at different IdPs to map to the same Vault secrets path.

More than one kerberos service may be defined.  Issuers will be
associated with the first defined service by default.  If an issuer
name matches one of the additional kerberos service names, that will
be used instead, or an issuer can explicitly select a kerberos service
with the `kerbservice` keyword.  

Vault reads keytabs from `/etc/krb5-<name>.keytab` where `<name>` is
the kerberos service name defined here.  If that file does not exist
the first kerberos service will read from `/etc/krb5.keytab` instead.
Each keytab should have a "host" key in it matching the machine name.

As examples here is a configuration for Fermilab supporting both fnal
and ligo kerberos services, and another supporting a CERN kerberos
service:

10-kerberos.yaml for Fermilab
```
kerberos:
  - name: fnal
    ldapurl: ldaps://ldap.fnal.gov
    ldapdn: o=fnal
    ldapattr: uid
  - name: ligo
    ldapurl: ldaps://ldap.ligo.org
    ldapdn: ou=people,dc=ligo,dc=org
    ldapattr: uid
```

10-kerberos.yaml for CERN
```
kerberos:
  - name: cern
    ldapurl: ldaps://xldap.cern.ch
    ldapdn: OU=Users,OU=Organic Units,DC=cern,DC=ch
    ldapattr: cn
    policydomain: "@cern.ch"
```

The reason for the policydomain on the second example is to pair with
an OIDC issuer `credclaim` of `eppn` (for eduPersonPrincipalName) which
includes `@cern.ch`.

#### Supporting kerberos robot credentials

Some Kerberos installations support the use of "robot" credentials for
unattended use cases, with kerberos principals of the form
`user/purpose/machine.name`.  htvault-config and htgettoken support
using them, if there is an OIDC `credclaim` that does not include the
`@domain` for those who log in to the OIDC token issuer using an 
IdP that matches the kerberos domain.  This is done
by allowing access to Vault paths that are of the form `user/*`,
along with htgettoken option `--credkey user/purpose/machine.name`
matching the kerberos principal.  For security reasons, if the OIDC
token issuer accepts multiple IdPs then if one of those other IdPs
are used the `credclaim` should include the IdP's `@domain` to avoid the
possibility of overlapping user ids mapping to the same Vault paths.

### SSH configuration

If you want to configure ssh-agent support use the `ssh` top-level
keyword.  There is only one parameter that needs to be set:

`ssh` keywords
| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---     | :--     |
| self-registration | Whether self registration of keys is allowed |

Set the value to `allowed` if you want to allow the htgettoken 
`--registerssh` option to self-register ssh public keys, otherwise
set it to `disallowed`.  Either value will enable ssh authentication.
For example this could be in 10-ssh.yaml:
```
ssh:
  self-registration: allowed
```

If you do not allow self-registration, you will need to provide the
ssh public keys with some other mechanism.  You will need to create a
vault token that is privileged enough to write into `auth/ssh/role/<user>`
where `<user>` is the user as identified by the OIDC `credclaim`
described above, and give it the parameter `public_keys` which is a list
of public keys.  For example, if the public key is a standard ssh public
key formatted file:
```
$ vault write auth/ssh/role/dwd public_keys=@sshkey.pub
```

It can also be done with curl or any other http client; see the vault
documentation for examples.

### Rate limits

Since the number of clients of one Vault service can be very large, and
token issuers put rate limits on the number of requests they accept from
one of their clients (including Vault), it is important to also put rate
limits on each of Vault's clients so that one of them cannot end up
using all the token issuer resources and so block the other Vault
clients from getting service.  

Vault has its own built-in 
[rate limit quotas](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/concepts/resource-quotas#rate-limit-quotas)
mechanism, and that can be configured through an htvault-config `ratelimits`
top-level keyword:

`ratelimits` keywords
| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---     | :--     |
| name | Rate limit name |
| path | Path within Vault to apply limit to, or "" for all paths |
| rate | The max number of requests in given interval |
| interval | The amount of time to enforce the rate |
| block_interval | The amount of time to block once limit is reached |

The `interval` and `block_interval` default to be in seconds, but
they're floating point numbers and can end in `s` for seconds, `m`
for minutes, or `h` for hours.

For example to set a limit for all Vault API paths to 360 requests from
each client every 5 minutes, and to block for 5 minutes if the limit is
reached:
```
ratelimits:
  - name: global
    rate: 360
    interval: 5m
    block_interval: 5m
```

While a client is blocked it will receive `HTTP 429 Too Many Requests`
responses.

### High availability

This package also supports an option of 3 Vault servers providing a
single high-availability service, using Vault's
[raft storage](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/vault/raft-storage)
feature.  To configure it, first you need to install the certificate of
the CA that certifies the host certificates of your servers into
`/etc/htvault-config/cacert.pem`.  This is needed so the servers can
verify the identity of each other.  Just like the host certificate, make
sure that it gets updated before it expires.

Next, set the following extra parameters under a `cluster` top-level
keyword:

`cluster` keywords
| Keyword | Meaning |
|:---     | :--     |
| name | Cluster name |
| master | Cluster master machine |
| peer1 | First peer machine |
| peer2 | Other peer machine |
| myname | Current machine name (optional, default \`uname -n\`) |
| auditlog | Path of the audit log (optional default /var/log/htvault-config/auditlog) |

All of the keyword values should be fully qualified domain names.
It is recommended to put all 3 machines behind a load balancer or DNS
round-robin, and set the full value as `name`, although it can be
tested by setting `name` to one of the individual machine names.
In the testing case in order to test one of the peers give its name as
the Vault server address to htgettoken `-a` and give the cluster name as
the `--vaultalias` option.  If kerberos is used then the kerberos keytab
on the master machine should contain a host key matching the cluster
name, and if the machines are behind a load balancer or DNS round-robin
then they all should have a `hostcert.pem` and `hostkey.pem` in
`/etc/htvault-config` that has a Subject Alternate Name that matches
the cluster name.

The `myname` keyword is only needed if \`uname -n\` does not match
the fully qualified domain name of the current machine when accessing
it externally.  That keyword may also be used in non-HA, single machine
configurations for the same purpose.

The `auditlog` keyword specifies an alternate path for the audit log,
since it can grow large on a busy system.
The default location is /var/log/htvault-config/auditlog.
If you move it to a different location, you are responsible for rotating
the log file.
The directory will be automatically created and owned by the 'vault' user.
If it is set to "none", no audit log will be created.
This keyword may also be used in non-HA configurations, but if it is an
HA configuration then the keyword needs to have the same value on all
the systems.

Here is an example:

10-cluster.yaml
```
cluster:
  name: htvault.fnal.gov
  master: htvault1.fnal.gov
  peer1: htvault2.fnal.gov
  peer2: htvault3.fnal.gov
```

The full configuration need only be set on the `master` machine.  The
other machines only need these cluster settings, no other configuration.
They should each list the same cluster `name` and `master` but set the
other two machines as their peers, for example on htvault2:

10-cluster.yaml
```
cluster:
  name: htvault.fnal.gov
  master: htvault1.fnal.gov
  peer1: htvault1.fnal.gov
  peer2: htvault3.fnal.gov
```

## Network accessibility

The vault service listens on port 8200 so make sure that is open through
iptables.  It needs to be accessible from all users' web browsers, so if
all users are within a LAN it does not need to be accessible through
firewalls to the internet.  On the other hand if it is a public server
accessible from anywhere then it does need to have a firewall opening.

With a High-Availability installation, port 8201 needs to be accessible
between the machines.

## Starting the service

The htvault-config systemd service ties itself to Vault, so starting or
restarting the vault service will also apply the configuration.
So to start the service simply do as root:
```
systemctl start vault
```

The htvault-config service can also be restarted independently without
restarting vault to reapply the configuration.  The output from
configuration goes into `/var/log/htvault-config/startlog` and logging
for Vault itself goes to `/var/log/messages`.  Previous settings for all
configuration parameters are saved, and only changed parameters are sent
to Vault.

### Bootstrapping high-availability

When bootstrapping a high-availability cluster, start it first on the
master machine.  After it has successfully started, copy its
`/var/lib/htvault-config/vaultseal.txt` and `~root/.vault-token` files
to the same locations on the other two machines before starting them.

Watch the `startlog` on each machine to see that all three machines
have joined the cluster and which one is the leader and which are
followers.  At any time you can see the status by running as root
```
export VAULT_ADDR=http://localhost:8202
vault operator raft list-peers
```
After initial bootstrapping, there needs to be at least two of the three
machines running in order for a leader to be chosen and service provided.
Writes get automatically redirected to the leader, although reads can be
done on any active server without contacting the leader.

## Testing the service

In order to test the service install
[htgettoken](https://github.com/fermitols/htgettoken)
on any machine that has access to port 8200 on the vault server.
If you have a default service configured you should be able to get a
token by simply running this as an unprivileged user:
```
htgettoken -a <your.host.name>
```
where `<your.host.name>` is replaced by the fully qualified domain
name of your Vault server.  Add `-i <issuer>` to select a specific
issuer and `-i <role>` to select a specific role.

## Recovery

If a vault database somehow gets corrupted and unable to be unsealed
according to the `startlog`, a way to get it in operation again is to
remove everything from `/var/lib/htvault-config` (including `.cache`)
and start vault again.  All the stored secrets will be lost.

### Changing high availability cluster machine names

If you want to change the cluster name, stop vault on all the servers,
change the name on all of them, and start them up again.  Any callback
URLs registered with OIDC issuers will need to be updated to the new
name, and if you use kerberos a new kerberos keytab matching the new
name should be installed.

If you want to change the master or either peer name, that can be done
one machine at a time while service continues.

To move the master to a different machine in the cluster, first stop
vault on the old master.  Copy all the configuration in
`/etc/htvault-config/config.d` from the old master to the new one, and
also copy `/var/lib/htvault-config/config.bash` so the new master will
be able to tell what the current configuration is.  Then change the
cluster configuration to list the new master and restart vault there
while leaving the third machine running.  That will remove the old
master from the cluster.  Whenever a machine is removed from the
cluster, it needs to be reloaded from scratch so remove everything in
`/var/lib/htvault-config` on the old master except for `vaultseal.txt`.
Then starting the old master will allow it to rejoin the cluster and
re-download the data.  Remember to change the master in the
configuration on the third machine as well although vault does not need
to be restarted.

Changing one of the peers is similar but a little simpler.  First stop
vault on the old peer, then change the peer configuration on the master
to have the new peer and restart vault on the master while leaving the
other peer running.  That will remove the old peer from the cluster.
The new one needs to start out with an empty `/var/lib/htvault-config`
except for `vaultseal.txt`, and remember to also copy
`~root/.vault-token` and the cluster configuration.  After the new peer
has joined the cluster, vault on the third machine also needs to be
restarted with the updated cluster configuration.
